<h1> Welcome to our website </h1> <br>
<big><p>Introduction: </p></big>
<small><small><p>Through this site, I hope that you will find that all issues are indeed Debateable.<br>
 

<br>I wish to provide as many people as possible with the skills to be “Debate able,” that is, able to debate. Thus, this site will provide an overview and analysis of the various elements of the WSDC format and provide readers with useful information, training tools, in-debate strategies and tips on how Debaters can improve themselves.<br>

 

<br>The best Debaters are those who constantly practise and refine their techniques. Reading books and websites on debate is only half the battle fought. The application of these skills in a systematic and diligent manner is absolutely essential for excellence in debating. Furthermore, every Debater is a unique individual with unique gifts. The techniques and tips recommended in this site should be applied in a critical manner; i.e., with the appropriate modifications to best suit each Debater’s needs.<br></br></p></small></small>
<h1> Devil's advocate </h1>
<p><br><big> Meaning:</big><br></br><small><small>1- Someone who supports an opposite argument or one that is not popular in order to make people think seriously<br>2- Someone who pretends, in an argument or discussion, to be against an idea or plan that a lot of people support<br>3- If you play devil's advocate in a discussion or debate, you express an opinion which you may not agree with but which is very different from what other people have been saying, in order to make the argument more interesting</p></br></font></small></small>

<big>An example of someone truly playing devil’s advocate might look like:<br></big>

<small><small><br>Person A: “The air quality has been so bad here recently that I’ve had to find ways to exercise inside.”

<br>Person B: “Yeah, I’ve been doing that too. But, to play devil’s advocate, how do you know the air in your house is any better? I read an article that said unless you have an air purifier or AC, there’s no difference in air quality.”

<br>Person B is introducing an opposing viewpoint without saying that they think it’s true or they agree with it. By presenting this alternative perspective, they’re making Person A think harder about the subject.

<br>The problem is that people aren’t typically using the devil’s advocate strategy to further the conversation. Instead, it’s often used as a method to silence those whose opinions, beliefs, or experiences don’t align with their own.
